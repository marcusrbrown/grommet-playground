# Grommet Playground

Browser playground for [Grommet](https://grommet.github.io), a UX framework for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

Grommet Playground is a tool for designing and experimenting with Grommet components. The Grommet documentation includes examples and interactive previews for several of its components, but the need arose for a more comprehensive set of interactive design and prototyping tools.

Grommet Playground is built with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org).
